# Predict Customer Retention at Syriatel Mobile Telecom Using Machine Learning
## Business overview

SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider, faces significant challenges in retaining customers. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates. By identifying customers likely to leave, SyriaTel can proactively implement targeted retention strategies, minimizing revenue loss and enhancing customer loyalty.

## Stakeholder
SyriaTel

## Problem statement
 
 Customer Churn: SyriaTel customer churn is very unpredictable; therefore, the business struggles to anticipate which customers are likely to stop using its services and why. This unpredictability results in reactive strategies, where the company focuses on damage control after customers have already decided to leave, rather than proactively preventing churn.
 
 ## Success Criteria
 
 Model Performance:
High accuracy to ensure high reliability in identifying customers likely to churn.

Actionable Insights:
Provide interpretable patterns or features that indicate customer churn, allowing SyriaTel to implement effective intervention strategies.

## Constraints

Data Availability and Quality:
The prediction model depends on access to clean, up-to-date, and comprehensive customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, and complaints.

Regulatory Compliance:
Ensure data handling complies with telecommunications regulations and privacy laws.
